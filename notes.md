- Get the project working using npm or yarn.

Basic Features:
- Change the vector display to show all numbers in the format d.ddd, like 0.334
- Use table to display the vectors
- Add a button to clear all vectors
- Add a checkbox to select vectors
    - Add a button to delete each vector
- Add a button to clear selected vectors
- Add a button to calculate the magnitude of the vector
    The magnitude of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

Advanced Features:
- Add a button to calculate the dot product of two selected vectors
    The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding components.
    The vectors must be of the same dimension.
- Add a button to calculate the angle between the selected vectors
    The angle between two vectors is the arccosine of the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes.
    The vectors must be of the same dimension.
- Add a button to calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors
    The cosine similarity between two vectors is the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes.
    The vectors must be of the same dimension.
